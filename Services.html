The library is open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm with no snacks or lunch breaks from Mondays to Fridays.<br>

The BCNHS Library exists primarily as a reference facility to all students, teachers, and non-teaching personnel and other individuals 
as maybe authorized by the librarian. It should not be mistaken for and utilized as a source of textbooks for personal use. It is to this 
end that the regulations have been made to allow full utilization of the limited library materials by numbers of borrowers.<br><br>

In borrowing a book, the following are helpful:<br><br>

a) Consult the card catalog.<br>

paid with the original cost. Borrowed books that are destroyed beyond repair shall also be considered for replacement or be paid by 
the borrower.<br>

5. Research Classes<br><br>

In the conduct of research classes, a written request to the Librarian and a reservation must be made at least one (1) day
