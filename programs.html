    <h3 id="1">K-12 Basic Education Curriculum</h3>
    <p><h2>Republic Act 10533, otherwise known as the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, mandated the implementation of the K-12 Basic Education Curriculum.<br>

POLICY GUIDELINES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GRADES 1 TO 10 OF THE K TO 12 BASIC EDUCATION CURRICULUM (BEC) EFFECTIVE SCHOOL YEAR 2012-2013
(DepEd Order No. 31, s. 2012)<br><br>

Effective School Year (SY) 2012-2013, the K to 12 Basic Education Curriculum (BEC) shall be implemented starting with the roll-out of Grades 1 and 7 in all
 public elementary and secondary schools. Private schools are enjoined to do the same.<br>
Schools are challenged to implement the guidelines in creative and innovative ways, for the curriculum can be localized without compromising the philosophy 
of total learner development.
IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES OF GRADES 1 TO 10 TO ENHANCED BASIC EDUCATION CURRICULUM<br>
(Excerpts from Enclosure No. 1 to DepEd Order No. 31, s. 2012)<br><br>
A. Design of the Curriculum<br>

The overall design of Grades 1 to 10 curriculum follows the spiral approach across subjects by building on the same concepts developed in increasing complexity
 and sophistication starting from grade school. Teachers are expected to use the spiral/progression approach in teaching competencies.<br><br>

B. Desired Outcomes of Grades 1 to 10 Program<br>

The desired outcomes of grades 1 to 10 program are defined in terms of expectancies as articulated in the learning standards. In general terms, students are 
expected at the end of Grade 10 to demonstrate communicative competence; think intelligently, critically and creatively in life situations; make informed and 
values-based decisions; perform their civic duties; use resources sustainably; and participate actively
in artistic and cultural activities and in the promotion of wellness and lifelong fitness.<br><br>

These general expectancies are expressed in specific terms in the form of content and performance standards.<br><br>
Content Standards as Benchmarks of Knowledge and Skills<br><br>

The content standards define what students are expected to know (knowledge: facts and information), what they should be able to do (process or skills) with 
what they know, and the meanings or understandings that they construct or make as they process the facts and information. Thus, the content standards answer 
the question: “What do students want to know, be able to do, and understand?”<br><br>

These expectations are unpacked in the Curriculum Guide in terms of learning competencies which can be adopted in the teaching-learning plan as instructional 
objectives.<br><br>

The content standards are stated in broad terms, i.e., “students are expected to demonstrate understanding of…” so that teachers, on the one hand, can 
differentiate how students will manifest their understanding, and students, on the other hand, can have the option to express their understanding in their 
own way. Thus, students are not just expected to understand, but they should be able to demonstrate or provide evidence of that understanding. Evidence-based
 understanding, therefore, makes the content standards measurable.<br><br></h2>

psycho-social background.<br>
